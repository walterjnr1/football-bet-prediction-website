        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the Website and services provided by <a href="http://surefixedwin.com/" target="_blank">http://surefixedwin.com/</a>

            SurebetWin offers carefully selected fixed correct score games sourced from trusted international and local contacts.
        </p>
        <p>
            We understand the risks of relying on unclear tournaments with limited transparency. Top leagues are monitored closely by media and governing bodies, unlike lesser-known championships where manipulation is more likely. Our aim is to share only high-quality, reliable information from our trusted sources — giving you the highest possible winning chances.
